<p>The two games I remember most from my childhood are <b>Angry Birds</b> and <b>Plants vs Zombies</b>. <br>For the emerging Internet, Internet 2.0 brings people endless exploration of new things. <br> <i>This novel experience is also expressed in these puzzle indie games.</i></p>

   <p class="game">My first contact with these two games was from a <a href="https://www.4399.com/" target="blank">Chinese gaming site</a>. <br> Of course, the games in here were <b>pirated</b>, 
      but I didn't realize that at the time. It was only when I grew up that I started to think about this issue.</p>

      <p>Since I lived in China during my childhood, <br>I was obsessed with <b>“QQ farm”</b>-- a web game derived from a Chinese social software. <br>It's a <b>interactive game</b>. You can buy seeds to grow vegetables and sell them for money when you collect them, and then buy more advanced seeds. <br>Also, You can <b>steal vegetables from your friends</b> or help spray pesticides on them to help them grow! <br>If you don't want your vegetables stolen you can get a dog, but it's expensive and doesn't last long. <br>All in all, it was played by both adults and children at the time.
